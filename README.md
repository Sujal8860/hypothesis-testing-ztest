# hypothesis-testing-ztest
This repository contains three hypothesis testing case studies using Z-tests to analyze different real-world scenarios. Each case involves setting up hypotheses, computing Z-scores, determining critical values, and making data-driven decisions.

Case Studies
📌 Example 1: Student Performance Analysis

Scenario: A teacher claims that the mean score of students in his class is greater than 82.
Hypotheses:
H₀ (Null): The mean score of students is ≤ 82
H₁ (Alternative): The mean score of students is > 82
Given Data:
Population standard deviation = 20
Sample size = 81
Sample mean = 90
Conclusion: Based on the Z-test, we determine whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis.
📌 Example 2: E-Commerce Website Redesign Impact

Scenario: An e-commerce company wants to analyze if a new website design has led to an increase in the average purchase amount.
Hypotheses:
H₀ (Null): The new design did not increase the average purchase amount.
H₁ (Alternative): The new design increased the average purchase amount.
Given Data:
Two sample groups (old design vs. new design)
Sample means, standard deviations, and sample sizes available
Conclusion: A Z-test is performed to verify if the new design has statistically improved purchase behavior.
📌 Example 3: Delivery Time & Customer Satisfaction

Scenario: A company wants to determine whether reducing delivery time increases customer satisfaction.
Hypotheses:
H₀ (Null): Reducing delivery time does not increase customer satisfaction.
H₁ (Alternative): Reducing delivery time increases customer satisfaction.
Given Data:
Population Mean (μ): 4.2
Sample Mean (x̄): 4.4
Sample Size (n): 30
Standard Deviation (σ): 0.5
Conclusion: The Z-test results indicate whether the improvement in delivery time has significantly impacted customer satisfaction.
